# QFECalculator_JavaFx

Analogous to my QFE Calculator Android application. Think of it as my "apology" for not making iPhone apps, now these people can use this on a Laptop or put it on another screen to have it in parallel with DCS.

Repo of the App: https://github.com/AlexBrueckner/QFE_Calculator
